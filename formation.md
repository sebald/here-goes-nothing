front, inner has to roll away if bank + bank
front should be fast ships?

outer ships can bank fast (be Fo) if inner + outer have vertical space at start

formation:

<inner | outer >

Rivas | Zeta
Zeta | Scorch

(shift backside ships to the inner, outer nub at middle e.g.)

after 2 banks:

Rivas: 2bl + roll right
inner zeta: 2bl
scorch 2bl
outer zeta: 3bl
