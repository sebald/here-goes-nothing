vr 1 rit + 2dmg -> 2 natural evade (damaged sencor array)
rivas dies to han
tavson 3 hits + crit (natual) -> only one evade/eye

extra dmg from obstacle, only focus :( no boost away, strained

use calculator to test if it was lucky to damage the falcon so much
flew very aggressiv with vonreg, was a lot in arcs

a lot of bumping have to learn how to better fly phasma alongside tavson
had to distribute damage on other ships too
