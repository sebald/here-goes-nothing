done

some good dice when it mattered made the game easier than it should have been. the key still was the first engagement and the time on target by my squad together with the ability to focus focus fire. I could shoot done one target after the other.

use calculator to test if it was lucky to damage the falcon so much
flew very aggressiv with vonreg, was a lot in arcs

a lot of bumping have to learn how to better fly phasma alongside tavson
had to distribute damage on other ships too
