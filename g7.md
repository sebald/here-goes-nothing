wedge into tavs for 2
vr for 4 into wedge -> 3 dmg
lando one into tavs
e-wing hit hit crit phas -> 1 shields (1 hit for rivas)
tavson -> 4 hits + crit into wedge -> one evade -> killed
rvias into lando, 0

vr -> 2hits one crit -> evades everything (we had to redo ...)
lando 2 for tavson

chooses phasma 1 phasma 1 vr
phasma for 2 hieds
tavson 3 into e-wing -> blanks
rivas hit / cirt -> evades
