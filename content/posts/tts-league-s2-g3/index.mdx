Another week, another league match. I pretty much reached the bottom of the ladder. But I am in good company. Holger, who was also 0:2 and was my opponent for this round. We chatted a little bit before the match. Even though none of us had a win under his belt, we both weren't bitter about our standing. Playing in this league is too much fun. I immeditaly had a feeling that this will be a friendly and welcoming game of X-Wing.

shortly after that I realized that I had a crit on scroch ... and then I removed the mini from the table.
