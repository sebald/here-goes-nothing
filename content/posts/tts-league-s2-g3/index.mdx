Another week, another league match. I pretty much reached the bottom of the ladder. But I am in good company. Holger, who was also 0:2, is my opponent for this round.

We chatted a little bit before the match. Even though none of us had a win under his belt, we both weren't bitter about our standing. Playing in this league is too much fun. I immeditaly had a feeling that this will be a friendly and welcoming game of X-Wing.

## Lists

*Note: This match took place on July 28th, not even eight hours before the points update.*

Holger brought a two ship Rebel list: Hand and Luke. Finally an opposing squad with less than 30 health! That said, both ships are equipped with some defensive upgrades, including a hull upgrade on Luke and hull plus shield upgrade on Han.

Because of his pilot ability, Luke has a defensive mod all the time anyway. Holger added an R5 droid to help Luke stay alive longer. Not quite as threatening as an R2, since it requires an action and repairs hull not shields but you can not allow Luke to get away and regen.

Han Han got Baze and Jyn on board. This means he can have a mix of up to three evade/focus tokens! Getting close to Han with multiple ships *and* shoot him isn't a great plan. He basically has a better reinforce with that crew setup.

To bolster the offensive power of the squad, Luke comes with a proton torp. With two force available the torpedo from Luke is super lethal and almost certainly result in four hits, including at least one crit.

Han has Ezra Bridger on board for the double tap and an additional reroll with lone wolf. Even if Han couldn't shoot twice a round, the force point from Ezra is another offensive or defensive mod. An uncontested Han would have mods for days and hit very hard.

I had packed the exact same least than last week. Kylo, Vonreg, Scorch and my new favorite FO pilo Lieutenant Rivas. As I said last week, this list is very plain when it comes to upgrades and specialities. It features quality pilots that work well together. And that's pretty much it.

Vonreg and Kylo are both serious threats. Especially the major has proven over the course of the last two games that he can carry the suqad if Kylo has to run a lot. Plus his ability to easily gain locks helps Rivas to double mod his attack when he is ignored. Another pilot you can not ignore is Scorch. His range one shots are dangerous, that TIE packs a punch.

As for my plan this game, I want to get to Luke first and focus fire him down with all my ships. Three out of my four ships only have four health. A single torpedo could kill them if dice fail me. I also don't want to half destory Luke and give him time to regenerate. The uncle has to go first.

Flying my ships together may also disable Han's Lone Wolf since Luke will be there too. Hopefully I can keep my ships in one of Han's arcs while hunting Luke. No ship in Han's arc would be even better of course, but I doubt that this will be possible.

And even thought I will try to ignore Han as much as I can at first, Scorch and Rivas will try to block him and attempt to restrict his movement.

If I get a block off Han has no action and can not use Jyn and Baze to get lots evade or focus tokens. Action economy on Han isn't that great anyway and denying him as much actions as possible might force him to turn his arc to instead of tokening up.

This plan has one problem. What if I don't destroy Luke fast enough and he can get to safety behind Han? Well, I don't really know. I guess it kind of depends on the game state.

If Kylo and Vonreg are still healthy enough, they should be able to easily hunt down a fleeying Luke. His only in a T-65 after all. The two FOs have to be enough to occupy, meaning block and deny movement, Han.

## Turn 0

While I didn't change my list, I did change my choice of obstacles. Because my opponents seem to favor smaller rocks and debris, I switched one gas cloud to antoher big rock, leaving me with the two largest rocks and a large gas cloud.

Holger brought two small rocks and the Y-shaped debris field.

I won the bid and let Holger go first. This is Finn-like big deal in this matchup I would say. Having Vonreg move after Han makes it easier to dodge the Falcon's arc with him. Kylo didn't get his pilot skills from his father, but with the same initiative than Luke he would still fly after him. Again beeing able to hopefully dodge any arcs that otherwise could mean an incoming torpedo.

![Turn 0](./0.jpg)

Playing obstacles, Holger tried to spread them as much as possible to make sure Han gets his rerolls. I just tried to cluster them in the center again. This might not be the optimal choice against an opposing Han, but I since there are four rocks I wanted to make it harder for Holger to fly the Falcon through the middle.

I placed my ships the only way I know how. Aces tugged into the corners and the FOs in the middle. Vonreg got the southern side of the board with lots of space. Kylo got the corner with the big fat rock at range two. Still enough space for the Silencer to do what ever he wanted.

I expected Holger to put the Falcon on the same flank Vonreg was and to circle be board from there. But he chose the northern flank facing Kylo instead. The three rocks would make Han's turn in predictable. Fine with me.

Luke got assigned to the middle of the board. He was very uncommited and could go either way, but since Han got placed face-to-face with Kylo I expected Holger to go after Kylo first. Like every opponent playing against my list. Shut the kid down.

## Turn 1

Like any good Rebel player, Holger did a one straight with both ships. I did go slow too. Kylo, Sorch and Rivas did a two straight. Kylo followed up his movement with a boost and barrel roll to join the two FOs and maybe pounce at Luke next turn.

Vonreg stepped out of line and did a three bank and a boost, threatening to flank Luke if the chose to fly further down in the middle.

![Turn 1](./1.jpg)

## Turn 2

The position of the Falcon made it so she only could fly forward or bank in with a three hard and because her arc was pointing foward the chances were high that Han could only shoot if the action was used for a rotation.

That's why I choose to go fast, ideally blasting past Han and having him to bank in next turn. All my ships did a five straight to collapse as fast as possible on Luke.

I expected Luke to do another one straight and fire a torpedo at something, but to my suprise he turned towards Vonreg's flank. He even closed his foils to boost and focus further away from the TIEs and Kylo.

Han followed Luke and also did also a two turn. Holger misjudge the distance of the maneuver, thank TTS, and Han barely landed on the rock. No damage on the rock roll, but Han was not allowed to shoot this round, with the arc still pointing forward there was no target anyway.

I was unsure about Vonreg's maneuver. Three bank? Five straight followed by a daredevil boost? I thought that with the position of Luke, going fast could not be punished by Holger, especially because there was no way he would get a lock on Vonreg. Plus it worked the last two games, right?

But this time it didn't. Because Luke turned towards Vonreg *and* boosted, Vonreg landed awfuly close in front of Luke. To dodge his arc, Vonreg did a barrel roll and a focus action, straining himself. Was that enough?

![Turn 2](./2.jpg)

... it wasn't. Vonreg was just a few pixels inside Luke's arc. Vonreg removed both shield from Luke but in return Vonreg lost both of his too. Too much blanks, plus the strain made sure of it.

Small side note, I have nothing in my notes saying that Luke only rolled two red dice. He should have because his foils were closed. I guess we forgot that, oops.

The remaining TIE shots pinged of one shield from Han. Scorch's shot on Luke through the rock did nothing. I didn't active Scroch. I wanted to keep more option open next round.

After the first round of combat, I already lacked behind. Half points on Vonreg meant 30 to nothing for Holger. I wasn't that concerend about the points though. A shieldless Vonreg at this point in the game felt really really bad. I had to be extra careful with him from now on. He was basically out of the game. Assuming he can escape Luke and an incoming Han.

## Turn 3

It tilted a bit. That was such bad flying. I was frustated with myself. It felt like I did not learn anything the past games. I knew better. As long as my opponent didn't chose between Kylo and Vonreg for his target, I have to fly Vonreg very cagey.

I needed a Qui-Gon moment to calm myself down and focus back on the game. 

![Meditate](./qui-gon.gif)

Rivas tried to block straight and left maneuvers from Han with a three bank so Han couldn't get where the action is, but rather had to circle around.

Scorch did a three hard to cut of Lukes escape path but landed right in Kylo's flight path. I dialed in another five straight for Kylo, hoping it would fit and even though it didn't, I liked the position he was in.

The Red Baron did his infamous one hard, followed by a lock on Luke and rolling away from the Jedi. He would have good escape paths for the next round.

Han dodged the block and flew a fast three bank towards Holders board edge.

![Turn 3](./3.jpg)

FIGHT!

## Turn 4

Uff. Another bad turn for me. Qui-Gon's advice didn't worked. So what about Kylo? I should let the past die.

shortly after that I realized that I had a crit on scroch ... and then I removed the mini from the table.
