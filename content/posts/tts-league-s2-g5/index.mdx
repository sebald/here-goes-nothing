We a currently have a scorching 35Â°C heatwave in southern Germany. I usually enjoy this kind of weather. Especially if I can lie at the pool with a cold beverage in hand. But to play X-Wing in front a computer? Not a fan.

Fortunately my opponents are usually very happy to play late in the evening when the kids are asleep. And so Philipp, my opponent for this week, and I met when the climate is tolerable after 9 pm.

## Lists

Because of the way too hot weather and some private matters I didn't really had time and energy to prepare a new list for this week. I still enjoy flying the "two aces backed up by two blockers" style of list, but wanted to try something different for a change. Last week I feld a bit exhausted flying the list and made some really bad decissions.

On the other hand, even though I am losing a lot with the list, flying it is the only way to get better at flying aces. Thus I am sticking with it, maybe even for the rest of the tournament.

I tried Deuterium Power Cells last week, which was really underwhelming. That's why I decided to give another underwhelming thing a chance, Scorch. He still feels expensive (33 points) for being an I4 cadet most of the time. His ability looks great on paper, but the additional dice is only great if you have mods.

Maybe he rather wants to be in a efficieny list than to be a blocker in a ace-y list. I don't know. I'll give him another chance. And because I am at 193, he will also get a Crack Shot.

Philipp brought a Resistance list that wants to joust. I must say I am very intrigued by his list. Two generic I3 T-70s plus Rose in the pod form a great tanky block with a lot of fire power. Flying Rose behind the X-Wings will give her at least to re-rolls.

Depending on the opposing squad, the two A-Wing can help with the joust or flank. A-Wing are also annoyingly efficient with their rotation arc and Advanced Optics. There is basically no way that they won't have a shot with two hits.

The list looks like quantitiy is king. But that five ships are very effective and efficient. Three of the five ships, Rose and the A-Wings, will always deliver at least two damage. The X-Wings are the back bone of the squad and can also dish out some real hurt. You definitely don't want to land in front of them.

For my list, obstacle placement is key. I really need to try to make a tight obstacle field so that there are no easy lanes for Rose and her two body guards. If it is possible I want to avoid fighting them and instead go after the A-Wings.

This is not going to be easy for Kylo and Vonreg. There are a lot of arcs to dodge. My aces certainly will be under fire, especially from the A-Wings. And despite the A-Wing only have 4 total health, it is behind a three green dice defense. I need modded shots at them to do damage.

## Turn 0

I win the bid since Philipp's squad comes it at a 200. I let him be first player so Kylo can move after Talli and Scorch after Greer. The later is not really important and maybe even bad, since the two TIEs are blockers and distraction rather than aces.

Philipp brought two clouds and a small rock. I have my usual two large rocks and the croissant cloud. The first obstacle, one of the rocks, is placed on my side of the board at range 2 of the board edges. 

With his jousting list, Philipp is of course trying to have the obstacles scattered all over the board. I try to prevent easy lanes and create a dense area in the middle of the board.

I put the last obstale right next to the first placed rock, which creates a vertical line of clouds in the middle and rocks on opposing sides of the board.

Turn 0 didn't turned out to be bad for me. I actually got what I wanted. I would rather have rocks in the middle of the board instead of clouds, but at least there are obstacles in the Resistance's way.

Philipp put the two X-Wings and Rose so that they can fly between the nothern gap of two gas clouds. The A-Wing protecting the flank. This is a really good and scary setup for me. I bascially have only one way in.

Because I had to put down Rivas before all the Resistance ships, he was kinda stranded in the middle of nowhere. And so was Scorch. Both have a lot of no mans land in front of them with no cover from obstacles.

I expected Philipp to put down his ball of death, Rose and her T-70 escort, on one of the sourthern lanes. Either all the way down, with the northern flank protected by the three obstacles, or to take the gap between the southern and middle gas cloud.

Kylo plays bait as usual. I deploy him facing the A-Wings. Vonreg gets to do his favorite thing, flank.

## Turn 1

Before we deployed our forces my plan was to get Talli or Greer and ignore the rest of the squad as good as possible but the way Philipp setup his ships would make that really hard.

I definitely didn't want to joust the whole Resistance squad at once. Hence I had to try to deceive the Ristance to spread out first and then try to catch either one of the groups.

This meant letting the Resistance come to me. Two straights for everyone. The First Order version of the Rebel's one straights. Only Vonreg advanced further with a follow up boost.

Rose and escort started their way towards the middle of the board with a three straight. Also a rather cautions move by Philipp, I guess.

The A-Wings on the other hand move a bit faster and even boosted down further.

Seeing that I chose to barrel roll away from the A-Wings with Kylo. He could go either way next turn. Flee or face the A-Wings.
