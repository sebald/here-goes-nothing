We a currently have a scorching 35Â°C heatwave in southern Germany. I usually enjoy this kind of weather. Especially if I can lie at the pool with a cold beverage in hand. But to play X-Wing in front a computer? Not a fan.

Fortunately my opponents are usually very happy to play late in the evening when the kids are asleep. And so Philipp, my opponent for this week, and I met when the climate is tolerable after 9 pm.

## Lists

Because of the way too hot weather and some private matters I didn't really had time and energy to prepare a new list for this week. I still enjoy flying the "two aces backed up by two blockers" style of list, but wanted to try something different for a change. Last week I feld a bit exhausted flying the list and made some really bad decissions.

On the other hand, even though I am losing a lot with the list, flying it is the only way to get better at flying aces. Thus I am sticking with it, maybe even for the rest of the tournament.

I tried Deuterium Power Cells last week, which was really underwhelming. That's why I decided to give another underwhelming thing a chance, Scorch. He still feels expensive (33 points) for being an I4 cadet most of the time. His ability looks great on paper, but the additional dice is only great if you have mods.

Maybe he rather wants to be in a efficieny list than to be a blocker in a ace-y list. I don't know. I'll give him another chance. And because I am at 193, he will also get a Crack Shot.

Philipp brought a Resistance list that wants to joust. I must say I am very intrigued by his list. Two generic I3 T-70s plus Rose in the pod form a great tanky block with a lot of fire power. Flying Rose behind the X-Wings will give her at least to re-rolls.

Depending on the opposing squad, the two A-Wing can help with the joust or flank. A-Wing are also annoyingly efficient with their rotation arc and Advanced Optics. There is basically no way that they won't have a shot with two hits.

The list looks like quantitiy is king. But that five ships are very effective and efficient. Three of the five ships, Rose and the A-Wings, will always deliver at least two damage. The X-Wings are the back bone of the squad and can also dish out some real hurt. You definitely don't want to land in front of them.

For my list, obstacle placement is key. I really need to try to make a tight obstacle field so that there are no easy lanes for Rose and her two body guards. If it is possible I want to avoid fighting them and instead go after the A-Wings.

This is not going to be easy for Kylo and Vonreg. There are a lot of arcs to dodge. My aces certainly will be under fire, especially from the A-Wings. And despite the A-Wing only have 4 total health, it is behind a three green dice defense. I need modded shots at them to do damage.
