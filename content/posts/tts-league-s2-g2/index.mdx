It's time for the second week of the [German TTS League](https://www.tabletop.to/xwing-tabletop-simulator-liga-deutschland)! I lost my first match as expected. Will I lose my second one? Well, I wouldn't bet on myself. But winning isn't my prime directive anyway. Learning is.

So what was my take away from the last match? Flying aces is hard, especially if you are relatively new to the game. But oh boy do I have fun flying these squirrly ships! Maybe I should switch to a faction that has real aces? ...nah!

Speaking of Imperials. My next opponent Hannes is flying Imps. This already gets me excited because most of the time when I play locally I fly against Scum. And while I don't despise Boba and whatever his wingman of the day is, I find it super exhausting flying against him.

Anyway, on to the game.

## Lists

Hannes told me before the game that he was sorry about his chosen squad. Reading my last post, he knew that I struggled flying against high health. This is why he chose to pack the most health he can think of for an Imperial squad and bring two shuttles and two Star Wings. 34 health, one more than I had to fight last week.

Seriously though, he chose the squad before he read my post. I am more than happy that someone takes the time to read what I write. You're allowed, no, entitled to bring whatever makes you happy. Afterall, I am the one flying the “meta” list 😄

Coordinate shenanigans again. This time paired with the ability to lock past range three. All to support the two ordnance carriers, which are armed to the teeth. It doesn't matter if you're at range one, two or three. They have an option to throw at least three dice at you. The range one Advanced Proton Torpedo is extra ugly.

Even the support ships, the two Lambdas, can dish out some real damage. With the Krennic crew one Sai he can remove shields or flip damage cards without me being able to do anything against that. Auto damage against my pool of 16 health.

Looking at what I brought. I am still excited about Kylo, Vonreg plus two FOs. Vonreg with Daredevil is just pure madness.

I swapped some upgrades and pilots for this match. I wanted to make the list more effective and only play stuff that has value regardless of the opponent's squad.

This means removing the Mag-Pulse Warheads and the Advanced Optics. It is only worth firing the warheads if Vonreg or Kylo is in trouble against another ace or to remove the lock from an ordnance carrier. Too bad my opponent brought not one but two ordnance carriers.

As for the Advanced Optics. Kylo always is the primary target. I am fine with that because it means Vonreg can do his thing and shoot with double mods. But if Kylo runs he doesn't need the optics. I find that optics on high initiative ships isn't that great anyway. You don't know if you need the focus for defense later and a target lock is almost as good for Kylo since he has the force.

This freed-up 10 points which I chose to invest in upgrading the TIE/fo pilots. 10 points is exactly enough for Rivas and Scorch. In my opinion the best TIE/fo named pilots. Rivas is only two points more than a cadet and will get free target locks from Vonreg. And other than a cadet, Scorch can not be ignored. Throwing up to four dice at a target is brutal. He is also I4 and can be an ace in some matchups.

The list is very vanilla, but has some extra triggers (Rivas) to remember. It's just a bunch of quality pilots the First Order has to offer. With five points the bid is the same as last week. I was thinking about putting Crack Shot on Scorch, but in my opinion 195 is the threshold for bidding. If you want to win the bid, you can not go higher. You probably even need to be a little lower to outbid others, minus Boba.

Looking at what the squad has to fly against. Neither Kylo nor Vonreg like to be the recipient of torps and missiles. None of my ships has the health to withstand the firepower of the Star Wings. Combined with the high health count, will make this no easy task.

There are no easy points. I can not expect to go in, destroy a ship and get out, leaving the FOs to die. I have to stick to one target for multiple rounds. Not necessarily the plan I have in mind with this squad. Knowing that the two FOs hold 60 instead of 50 points I need to secure an extra 10 points. A clear disadvantage in investing in better pilots.

I thought my best option was the Star Wings. I wanted to take down one of them as fast as possible and then take half points on my next best option, depending on the game state.

## Turn 0

Hannes brought three of the smaller debris as obstacles. I am still not sure why. I guess the Lambdas don't care about stress, they are better for him than clouds and of course you usually don't bring large rocks when playing two large bases.

I packed the two large gas clouds and the largest rock again. After the match and how the obstacles got placed I am no longer sure that this is the correct choice for the list. Maybe it is just because of the lists I am flying against but dang I want more rocks on the battlefield.

Since I won the bid, I chose Hannes to go first. Clearly a mistake if there is only one real obstacle, the rock.

Hannes tugged the rock in the corner on my side. Great. I grabbed one of the clouds and tried to get as many obstacles in the center of the battle field as I could. Hannes stuck to this plan and put his remaining obstacles, the other cloud and one debris field in the other corners while I created a diagonal lane with the remaining two debris fields. I hoped that this would split the battlefield into two zones and leave no lanes for the Lambdas.

![Turn 0](./0.jpg)

Hannes placed his ships in groups of two. The two Lambdas were facing down the northern edge of the board. The two Star Wings started horizontally right next to them. Sai got assigned the Optimized Prototype. By the looks of Hannes formation the Lambdas would occupy the northern zone of the board, while the Star Wings took care of the southern part of the mat.

I did the usual. FOs in the middle. Kylo and Vonreg start in opposite corners to react to the first few turns of movement. At least that's the idea. The only adjustment I made was placing the FOs such that they would fly directly at an obstacle. I wanted the option to bank either way with them. The potential of slamming Star Wings made me wary.

## Turn 1

As expected, Hannes slow-rolled the first turn with the Star Wings and used Jendon to acquire locks. Sai and the green Starwing locked Kylo. The brown Starwing locked Vonreg.

My ships all did two straights. This is me going slow, I guess.

In addition, Kylo rolled back to have more options next turn. Vonreg boosted to face down the board and threaten the flank where both Star Wings were fyling. Scorched rolled right so that he and Kylo potentially could go after the shuttles next turn.

At least I hope that was what it looked like. I never planned to face the shuttles directly. Rolling Scorch towards them just gave him a better angle to fly through the obstacles with a three bank next turn.

![Turn 1](./1.jpg)

## Turn 2

Hannes did go slow with his Star Wings again. The shuttles strolled further down the northern lane towards Kylo.

Because the shuttles are so slow and need time to get through the obstacles in the center of the board I kicked off my plan to catch the Star Wings without their support. Full throttle with all my ships!

Vonreg did a five straight and rolled left to be out of any arcs. Scorch did a three bank to land between the two debris fields. Rivas passed the rock and debris with a two bank. Even Kylo, trailing behind as usual, advanced in the direction of the Star Wings.

I didn't want to go too fast with Kylo. I hoped to bait the shuttles into further trying to hunt down Kylo instead of my other ships. He had two locks on Kylo anyway, I couldn't take the risk of engaging with him.

![Turn 2](./2.jpg)

Scorch and the green Starwing exchanged shots through the debris. No damage. Everyone else didn't have a shot.

## Turn 3

This was the crucial turn for my plan to get to the Star Wings without the shuttles helping out. Hannes slow-rolled the first two turns, hence I wanted to go fast again.

With the Star Wings still trying to catch Vonreg, I dialed in another five straight. With the option to Daredevil boost even slow maneuvers couldn't catch him and there was a good chance that at least one of the Star Wings will end up in his arc.

And the brown Star Wing did! As I hoped the debris protected Vonreg. The brown Star Wing couldn't turn right to face Vonreg.

With a three bank from Rivas and a five straight from Scorch, they also got in range of the Star Wings. Both were in a good spot to shoot at the brown Star Wing. Only Scorch ended up in a wacky position between the two Star Wings.

Seeing that now I maybe did a mistake here. Even though Scorch's shot would have been unmodded, a barrel roll to the right would have brought him out of the arc of all opponents. He would have been in a better position for next turn too. At the time I just wasn't scared of the two Star Wings shooting at Scorch. He shot first and I choose violence!

Kylo chose the save route. Now with three locks (!) on him, he did not want to have anything to do with it. He banked left and rolled left to get out of the arcs.

![Turn 3](./3.jpg)

Shooting through the debris Vonreg pinged off one shield from brown using his lock. Scorch activated and rolled four hits, which resulted in three hits. One more than expected.

In return the combined fire power of Star Wings only got rid of Scorch's shield.

With the shields gone a double modded Rivas, put a hit/crit into brown. The crit stuck and was a direct hit. The brown Starwing remained with only one hull left.

I traded six damage for one. A very good start for me thanks to some better than average dice. Sprinting everything forward was worth it and catched Hannes off-guard.

## Turn 4

The shuttles were closing in on the battle. I blocked brown’s escape path with a hard one from Rivas. Scorch then bumped into brown, clearing his stress. Two guns that will not shoot this turn, ugh.

Anticipating this happening I chose to bring in Kylo. I wanted to make sure the brown Star Wing is destroyed and I wasn't sure if Vonreg alone could do it. I actually wasn't certain that Vonreg hat a shot at all.

I considered doing a two straight with Vonreg and then Daredevil-ing with a single modded attack (target lock). I wasn't sure if a two straight was enough to pass the debris, so I dialed in three straight instead.

![A few pixels out of Vonreg's arc](./nope.jpg)

The brown Star Wing ended up just a few pixels out of Vonreg's arc. Not got. This meant I only had one shot from Kylo to finish the job.

And while I was fairly certain that Kylo could do it, there still was the other Star Wing. A double modded rocket attack would hit Kylo this turn. Worth it? I don't know.

![Turn 4](./4.jpg)

In anticipation that the boost would bring brown in arc, Vonreg had a target lock on him. So the shot on green was unmodified, but still pinged off a shield.

Kylo finally destroyed the brown Star Wing. In return, the green Star Wing stripped off Kylo's shields. The force couldn't help the dark lord this time. Two blanks, one evade.

Jendon finished off the round with a shot at Scorch, who suffered hit/crit. The crit was Disabled Power Regulator. Uff, that hurt. I had to get Scorch in a position next round, where he still could be useful the round after. All while Hannes knew where Scorch would be.

## Turn 5

After a good start, I lost ground. Although I got rid of the brown Star Wing, two of my ships suffered a lot of damage. Plus, the position of Kylo meant that he had to run from the green Star Wing while his right flank was shut down by the two shuttles. There were no good escape route for him anymore. 

The two FOs were also not in a prime position to do damage and be relevant. Only Vonreg was where he should be. In no arc and firing at things.

![Turn 5](./5.jpg)

I couldn't lose any points with Kylo. There wasn't enough time left to shoot down one of the remaining ships to make up for him. So I crossed my fingers and dialed in a five straight with Kylo, hoping to dodge as many arcs as possible.

Even with a slam the green Star Wing couldn't get Kylo in his arc even though the block from Rivas failed. The Star Wing and the lieutenant wouldn't shoot at anything this round. Scorch on the other hand was in a position to put another four red dice into the Star Wing.

Jendon flew over the debris. He got a coordinated focus by Sai, who flew directly behind Jendon. Thanks to his ability, Sai also had a focus.

Vonreg flanked the shuttles and started shooting at Jendon. Because Vonreg rolled left to be out of Sai's arc, the obstructed shot into Jendon only removed one shield. Scorch's single modded four-dice attack into the green Star Wing pinged off two shields.

To my surprise Jendon and Sai had someone in their arc that shouldn't be there, Kylo. I was so focused on rolling and boosting out of the Star Wing's arc that I had forgotten how huge the args of large ships are.

Jendon shot first and rolled hit, hit, crit. I rolled two blanks and an eyeball.. The second time in a row, the green dice failed me. The crit was a Fuel Leak. So better not suffer any crits. Or even better, do not suffer any damage at all anymore.

However that’s not quite what happened. Sai's shot only showed one eyeball and probably would have been a miss. But since Sai had the Optimized Prototype assigned, Hannes spent the result to flip the damage card: a Panicked Pilot.

Kylo sat there with three stress, the third one from Autothrusters. This was the worst crit I could think of in this situation. There was no way to escape the slamming Star Wing now. Not being able to reposition with Kylo was his death sentence.

With half points on Kylo and Scorch Hannes took the lead, 55 to 48.

## Turn 6

The least I could do was try to save Kylo. I dialed in a five straight. It was a desperate move because none of the FOs could block the Star Wing, they both faced in the other direction. Scorch was ionized from the crit anyways so I sent our Rivas to block the shuttles and deny actions. Vonreg turned right, locked Jendon for a strain and took a focus as regular action.

Taking the strain was risky but I also was longing for points. Scorch or Kylo, in the worst case both, would not live until the end of the game. I needed points.

![Turn 6](./6.jpg)

Vonreg stripped off the remaining three shields from Jendon. Only one more health until half points. Both shuttles fired back at Vonreg only removing one shield from the baron, phew. Unmodded dice are great!

Now it was the green Star Wing’s turn to finally revenge his brother. Another barrage rocket and not so great dice on my side ended the chase. Kylo was gone. Not being able to spend any force to save him, Kylo was removed from the board with all two force available.

Rivas, with no lock on Sai because I forgot that his ability also triggers with stress, still got rid of two shields. I was really surprised what these little FOs can do.

## Turn 7

I was desperate for points. Hannes extended his lead in the last round to 93. That was a much higher number than what I wanted. Time for a hail mary.

Scorch, back in the fight with one health, tried to turn in and shoot at something. Ideally at Jendon but he was too close. Scorch and Jendon bumped into each other.

Rivas did a three turn left, setting up a block for Sai and hopefully helping out Vonreg getting half points for the Star Wing. The green Star Wing landed directly in front of Rivas.

![Turn 7](./7.jpg)

The double modded but depleted shot from Vonreg into the Star Wing did two damage. Three of the seven health left meant half points, yay!

Hannes took some time to think about his last shots. The Star Wing could shoot at Vonreg and Rivas. Sai had only Vonreg sitting in front of him. Jendon could shoot Rivas or Vonreg from his rear arc.

Sai opened the round of fire, shooting at Vonreg. The focus token prevented any damage on Vonreg. Jendons shot into Vonreg did also no damage. With one shield remaining the baron was holding on to his points.

The Star Wing had a focus and a lock on Rivas. It was finally time for the Advanced Proton Torpedo! Three hits and two crits one-shotted Rivas and the game was over.

Hannes took the victory with 120 to 72. Congrats! 🙂

## Conclusion

I am really happy that I participate in the league. Even though I am now 0:2, I learned a lot playing in this environment. I expect to lose a lot in my first tournament anyway. I don't feel bad about it. Especially because I had two great games against even greater guys. It really is true what they say, the X-Wing community is full of great people.

![It's true. All of it](./han.gif)

Regarding the game, I find that I got a head start in the first part of the game. My plan throwing everything at the Star Wings worked. I got rid of one while the Lambdas were still on their way to the battle.

Bit I messed up keeping my guns pointed at the enemy ships afterwards. Sure I destroyed one of the Star Wings, but there was no follow up. Rivas and Scorch didn't really shoot enough for the rest of the game. Only Scorch got one good shot off after the initial engagement. It's really bad if Vonreg is the only one shooting.

Revisiting the positions after the fifth round, I maybe should have turned Kylo in and got a last shot off at one of the shuttles. It certainly would not have won me the game, but I maybe would have gotten half points for Jendon.

As for obstacles, I understand now why some players bring the three big rocks. When you play small and fragile but mobile ships you do not gain that much from the gas clouds compared to your opponent. You both can ignore them. You need something in the way of large and immobile ships that they have to respect. Guess I am overthinking my choice of obstacles for the next game.

Until then! If this trend continues my next opponent will surprise me with a list that has 35 total health. 😆
