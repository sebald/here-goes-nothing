After my win last week I am now 1:2. I don't feel good or bad about my standing in particular. It's good to know this will not end in a total disaster by me winning not a single game.

My opponent for this week is Peter. Another friendly Bavarian. We briefly talked about the X-Wing community and its average age before our game. Yes, we are all old, but it is part of what makes this game so enjoyable. We're all much more relaxed.

## List

This is my first game after the latest points update. The First Order came off mostly unscathed. In fact, the TIE/ba even got cheaper. Two more points that can be spent otherwise. The stapled Daredevil on Vonreg basically is free now.

There is one more other upgrade I wanted to test: Deuterium Power Cells. I have to bench Scorch and downgrade the second TIE/fo to a cadet for it, but I wanted to try blockers with the same initiative anyway. Two birds with one stone.

As I said over the past few weeks, I really enjoy flying this style of two aces and two blockers. It reminds me a lot of the two Jedi, two torrent squads from last year. 

However, the TIEs are much better blockers than the torrents. The white one hard followed by a barrel roll allows to set up some really excellent blocks and the shield behind three green dice make the little TIEs more durable than they look.

Delta-7B Jedi are arguably better aces than Vonreg. Kylo on the other hand is definitely on par with Obi and Plo. I gave Vonreg a hard time when I started playing him, but he grew on me. It requires some time to learn how to fly him properly ... not saying that I am there yet.

Like his fellow Bavarian last week, Peter brought a Rebel fleet. Three E-Wing packing torps. An alpha strike squad at its finest.

<XWS list={{"description":"","faction":"rebelalliance","name":"Unnamed Squadron","pilots":[{"id":"roguesquadronescort","name":"roguesquadronescort","points":63,"ship":"ewing","upgrades":{"sensor":["firecontrolsystem"],"torpedo":["plasmatorpedoes"],"astromech":["r4astromech"]}},{"id":"roguesquadronescort","name":"roguesquadronescort","points":68,"ship":"ewing","upgrades":{"sensor":["firecontrolsystem"],"torpedo":["protontorpedoes"],"astromech":["r4astromech"]}},{"id":"roguesquadronescort","name":"roguesquadronescort","points":68,"ship":"ewing","upgrades":{"sensor":["firecontrolsystem"],"torpedo":["protontorpedoes"],"astromech":["r4astromech"]}}],"points":199,"vendor":{"yasb":{"builder":"Yet Another Squad Builder 2.0","builder_url":"https://raithos.github.io/","link":"https://raithos.github.io/?f=Rebel%20Alliance&d=v8ZsZ200Z23XW113W234W5WY23XW113W136W5WY23XW113W136W5W&sn=Unnamed%20Squadron&obs="}},"version":"2.0.0"}}/>

Torps are not really what I want to face with my squad. Especially if my opponent can preemptively acquire locks past range three. If any locked ships get in range of the E-Wing they will be erased immediately. Of course, that is kind of the whole plan of an alpha strike list.

My FOs will have a hard time to deal any damage to the E-Wings because of their three defense dice. If I don't get a block off they are basically useless. Because I expect one of my aces to be range controlled with locks, I only have one ship that can deal damage to the E-Wings.

And it's not like if the E-Wings are a joke if they don't fire their munitions at you. They still have three attack dice. They easily match the firepower and durability of my aces. The only weakness they have is that they can not double reposition and have one action.

As for strategy, I want to bait the E-Wings with one of my aces and hope they turn on him so that the rest of my squad can come in and focus fire on one E-Wing. The generic E-Wings with R4, FCS and torp are very expensive. They cost about the same as Vonreg with the Power Cells. If I can destroy one and only lose Vonreg or the TIEs I should be fine.

## Turn 0

We both seemed to have the same plan when it comes to rock placement and so most of the obstacles ended up in the center of the board. I placed the single gas cloud in the middle to maybe have an additional free evade against the incoming torpedos.

I deviated from my usual setup because Peter tugged his whole squad into one side of the board. Kylo was telegraphing what his plan was. Go fast and flank. The rest of the squad got placed as usual. I put Vonreg in a 45° into my corner facing all of his E-Wings. He was the bait.

Jousting the E-Wings with my list was not an option. The two FOs got assigned the middle lanes. They could flank the Rebels after they have chosen one of the aces as their target.

![Turn 0](./0.jpg)

## Turn 1

Vonreg and the two TIEs did the usual non-committing two forward. Kylo dashed forward with a five straight followed by a boost. He landed in a good spot behind a rock and could flank next round or bail out with a hard one.

The E-Wings all flew straight and forming a diagonal line. The yellow E-Wing, which was the one closest to the board edges moved the furthest. Red moved the least.

With this formation the Rebel ships could easily turn next rund to face Kylo even though they all locked Vonreg this turn. Because of all the locks Vonreg got and the possibility of an incoming torpedo attack, the major rolled back to get some distance between him and the E-Wings.

![Turn 1](./1.jpg)

## Turn 2

The positioning of the E-Wing made it hard to predict their next move. Excellent flying on Peter's side.

I chose to not fully commit yet and dialed in two speed maneuvers for the FOs and Vonreg. My idea with Vonreg was to fly a two straight and have the option to barrel roll depending on the Rebel's movement.

Vonreg ended up further than I had anticipated. The barrel roll would fit but place him behind the rock. I originally planned to do a Daredevil boost afterward the roll to close in on the E-Wings. Seeing where he landed after the roll though, the boost would not fit. That was a very poor decision on my part. I would have to fly him over the rock next turn, ugh.

I decided to commit with Kylo and diald in a three bank. I wasn't sure if a five straight would fit. It might have touched the north-east rock, which would have been really bad. One ship flying over a rock is bad enough.

There were two reasons I decided to get aggressive with Kylo. First, there was a big fat rock between Kylo and the E-Wings, which would make hard turns suboptimal for the E-Wing. Especially because the hard one is red on the E-Wing's dial ... at least usually.

The other reason was that all locks were on Vonreg. Even if Peter decided to turn all his ships to Kylo I could dodge at least one or even two of the arcs and incoming shots were only primary attacks, not torps.

Or so I thought. In my mind the E-Wing ability was the same as Jendon’s, something you can do once or twice a game. I was completely blindsided when Peter just locked Kylo this turn with all three ships. Again, expert flying by Peter.

I also forgot about the R4s, which make the one hard white. Followed by a roll, the red E-Wing landed in a perfect spot, avoiding the rock. Peter outplayed me hard this round and my bad flying made it even easier for him.

![Turn 2](./2.jpg)

On the bright side, because the other two E-Wing didn't fully commit on Kylo and only did banks instead of turns, the three bank from Kylo, followed by a double reposition got him out of two arcs. Only the red E-Wing with the Plasma Torpedos had a shot on him.

![Kylo dodging shots, that was close!](./kylo-dodging.jpg)

Kylo and the red E-Wing exchanged shots. Spending two force, the Plasma Torpedo missed and wouldn't strip an extra shield from Kylo. Kylo didn't do any damage to Red either.

## Turn 3

There was a lot of distance between the Rebels' fighting Kylo and the rest of my squad. So I tried to close it as fast as I could. Five straight for the cadet and a three bank for Rivas and Vonreg. Vonreg took one damage from flying over the rock.

This could go either way. The E-Wing could keep chasing Kylo and have my squad behind them or they could joust my squad and have Kylo behind them. I actually didn't notice this during the game, but this wasn't a too bad spot to be in. It felt otherwise back then though.

The yellow and green E-Wing turned on Kylo with a *white* one hard. I only played against E-Wings carrying R3s so far. But boy oh boy are these little droids good on them. It makes them so much more mobile and hard to dodge.

The R3 also helped Red to clear his stress from last round by flying a *blue* two hard. He tried to block Kylo's escape route with a barrel roll.

Ignoring Red, Kylo slipped right through the E-Wings with a three straight. The barrel roll and boost brought him out of all except one arc again.

![Turn 3](./3.jpg)

Unfortunately that one arc had a double modded range one shot on Kylo. Peter spent a focus to acquire three hits and a crit, which resulted in Kylo losing both of his shields.

Vonreg and the two FOs could only get one damage through on Yellow, even with spending two locks. It showed that the "two dice"-guns from the TIEs were no match for the three defense dice from the E-Wings.

## Turn 4

The cadet got strained from flying through the gas cloud, but I couldn't care less. He had some ships to block! Also, Peter shooting at the cadet would only be good for me, less pressure on my aces.

Rivas and Vonreg flew as slow as they could. They were in the E-Wing's back and Peter had already committed to Kylo which meant they were relatively safe. Vonreg re-acquired a lock on Yellow also donating one to Rivas.

Kylo was still on the exit trajectory. Flying a two hard and focusing for additional defense.

Instead of doing hard turns, like I assumed, the yellow and green E-Wing slooped. Good choice since Yellow's one hard would have been blocked by the cadet.

The red E-Wing was kind of out of the fight. He had to use this round to fly around the rock. Because Red acquired another past range three lock on Vonreg, the major had to barrel roll out of his arc, depleting himself.

![Turn 4](./4.jpg)

The deplete on Vonreg hurt, but straining wasn't an option either. He only was on three health, thanks to the rock and a lucky shot from one of the E-Wings could have blown him up. While unlikely, this happened to me way too often in the past.

Neither Vonreg, nor Rivas could do any damage to yellow. Again, two attack dice against three or even four defense isn't going to do much. The Rebels' return shots on Rivas and Vonreg were also unsuccessful.

## Turn 5

The game was still relatively even. Peter was a little bit ahead of course. He was one damage away from half points on both of my aces. But hey! That's why I brought the Deuterium Power Cells right!

This turn the E-Wings would be back in the fight with some fully modded shots. Trying to prevent that, Rivas slooped to block. The cadet did a hard one and tried to barrel roll but failed, leaving him in an not so optimal position.

Seeing the positioning after turn four, I should have slooped with the cadet. Back then I was scared of a hard one from Yellow, because I wanted Kylo to turn back to the fight. But a hard turn from Yellow would not have cleared the stress and would leave the E-Wing in an awkwards spot. The chances that Peter would do this were zero to none.

Doing a one hard, I chose the aggressive route with Kylo again.

The reason is simple. Kylo still had two locks from Yellow and Green. A five straight plus boost would not bring him out of range if the E-Wing went fast. So I decided to stay and rather get some range one shots into Kylo than a range three Proton Torpedo. At least Kylo could shoot back this way.

The red E-Wing finished his tour around the asteroid and joined the fight. The other two Rebels advanced with a one and a two bank, clearing their stress and focusing up.

Here comes another mishap by me. One that would turn the game against my favor. Are you ready!?

Knowing that Green and Yellow would have to clear their stress and thus flying directly towards Vonreg, I dialed in a 5k for him. This would have been a great move, if the cadet would not have blocked the maneuver. He barely blocked it ... but he did because of the previously failed barrel roll.

And so Vonreg stranded in the middle of everything with no shot, no mods and a potential incoming range one shot from Green. What a fail.

![Turn 5](./5.jpg)

Kylo's shot at Yellow resulted in stripping of the remaining two shields and even ended up in a crit for the E-Wing, which was a Damaged Sensor Array. Rivas had another range one shot on yellow. The two crits (!) missed because Peter rolled natural evades. Didn't even have to spend the focus.

The green E-Wing fired a Proton Torpedo at Kylo. Spending the lock, Green got two hits and two crits, which were met by two blanks and only one paint from Kylo. A direct hit made sure Kylo would not survive this round. That was brutal.

To make things worse, the red E-Wing could now fire a Plasma Torpedo at Vonreg. The k-turn failed and so the major was still in his arc. This time the Plasma hit and removed the last shield from Vonreg and did an additional damage. The TIE/ba survived with one hull left.

As you probably noticed, this was the turn everything went downhill for me. *If* Vonreg's maneuver would have fit, he would have had a shot on yellow, the E-Wing most likely would have been destroyed and would make losing Kylo okay. Vonreg would have also dodged all arcs and the red E-Wing would have had a range three shot into Rivas.

But that's a lot of "ifs". As it stands, Rebel gained the lead with 109 to 0.

## Turn 6

With only a limping damage dealer left this would be an uphill battle for the rest of the game.

To get shots on Yellow the cadet slooped this round and Rivas tried to block his escape routes, while hopefully dodging as many arcs as possible. The E-Wings closed in on Rivas. Yellow bumped into him but the other two Rebels had shots.

Vonreg could have turned 180° even though he was stressed thanks to a Daredevil boost, but it was too dangerous and so I used the Power Cells to recover a shield instead.

I hoped that the game would go long enough to recover another shield. This would put Vonreg above half and give Peter no points for Vonreg and maybe the FOs could finish the yellow E-Wing in the meantime.

![Turn 6](./6.jpg)

The two E-Wings could only strip off Rivas' shield. The cadet, which by the way still carried around his strain token from round two, missed Yellow.

## Turn 7

Vonreg turned his guns back to the fight. Double modding for a shot at Yellow. Rivas did a one hard, because he didn't have any other option. The cadet clearing his stress and strain two banked towards yellow.

The yellow E-Wing hat to turn to Vonreg. The other E-Wings closed in on Rivas. Why I don't know. I expected the red Rebel to turn left to face Vonreg and try to remove him.

![Turn 7](./7.jpg)

Vonreg's double modded shot required me to spend both mods to get three hits. The green E-Wing rolled two natural evades, leaving him at one hull. He didn't even have to spend his focus token to survive. This was bad because Yellow could fire back now.

Red and Green fired everything they had into Rivas, but due to some hot green dice and a focus token no damage got through.

Here comes Yellow, rolling two hits into Vonreg. Because I had to spend the focus on offense, no defense mods for this shot. But I wouldn't have mattered anyway. Three blanks meant a destroyed baron.

The cadet with his range one focused shot, avenged Vonreg. He could finally remove Yellow from the board.

142 to 68 for the Rebels.

## Turn 8

Even though we still had one more round to play, the game was over. My TIEs would not be able to half one of the E-Wings. I tried to set up blocks and bad shots for Peter. The one unmodded shot he had missed Rivas.

The game ended with another loss for me. 142 to 68. This was the first time I lost both of my aces because of some bad flying. I would call this my worst game yet.

## Conclusion

Reexamining this match, I have to say that playing it felt much worse than it was in reality. It felt like I was behind from the beginning, which isn’t true. I guess that has to do with my inexperience. It's tough to correctly evaluate the board state if you are new to the game.

I faced a semi alpha strike squad in my second game, but I don't know if I would count that as one since there were only two gunboats and Barrage Rockets aren't that scary as Proton Torpedos.

The E-Wing's loadout definitely catched me off guard. I underestimated their mobility. 

I didn't underestimate their fire power and durability though. Over the past few games I noticed that my squad has issues destroying ships with lots of green dice or health. This is especially true if one of the damage dealers has to run for his life and can not participate in the fight.

Adding Deuterium Power Cells is definitely a mistake. Vonreg shouldn't get shot in the first place. The regen doesn't add anything to the strength of the list. Furthermore, Vonreg not being able to shoot is bad. You can not afford not to shoot with him. You need his damage output.

The squad from my last two games clearly is the better combination. It even dropped two points, with which you can either have a very strong seven point bid or add Crack Shot/Fanatical on Scorch if you want.

Adding more points to the TIEs doesn’t feel that great and I don't think it helps much. There was a leak last week with an upgrade that might be great for the squad though!

> **Evasive Maneuvers:** While you perform a boost action , you may spend 1 force to use the turn template instead.

If this is correct and not too pricey, it will make Kylo even better than he already is. Having two aces that can Daredevil seems amazing! 🙏

So far three-quarters of my opponents brought munitions. Two of them even had munition as their primary damage output. I hope I can get a break next time ... or should I join them?
