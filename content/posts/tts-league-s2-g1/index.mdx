The [second season of the German TTS league](https://www.tabletop.to/xwing-tabletop-simulator-liga-deutschland) started last week. This will be my very first tournament after getting into X-wing almost one year ago. My goal is obviously not to win. I want enjoy the experience, have a good time with awesome people and hopefully get a little better at the game along the way.


So if your looking for some real content, I guess you should rather checkout [Phil GC's](https://suchanxwinghipster.wordpress.com/) or [Dylan's](http://dylan-jones.co.uk/) blog. Shoutout to both them. They inspired me to start this project of writing battle reports and to share what I was thinking ... or not thinking. I hope that revisiting my games will help me notice mistakes and learn from them.

*The game was also streamed by [funwok](https://www.twitch.tv/funwok). If you rather want something more visual and good commentary (in German), you can [watch the game on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/680608539).*

## Lists

Roger is my first opponent and luckily for me he knew that this was my first tournament. He brought a fun list rather than his battle-tested tournament list. Phew.

That said, it didn't really made it easier for me. Because I never flew against two large base ships with that much health and fire power. Let alone all the coordinate and Leia shenanigens.

I only played X-wing against two other people. Bring whatever you want. It will be a new challenge for me ðŸ˜€

Funwok, who commented the match, called my list *meta*. Fair enough. I feel most comfortable flying aces and I like the FO as a faction. Especially the TIE/ba has grown on me over the past months.

I have yet to find the perfect balance for me on how to kit out Kylo and Vonreg. And how much bid do I need? 195 feels safe, but maybe 196 or 197 is fine too?

## Turn 0

Roger brought the smalles gas clouds. The obvious choice for this large, bulky ships. I brought the largest asteroid and two of the new gas clouds. Following [Oli's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCfxSF4itv8) I tried to create a dense area somewhere on the mat, where the movement of the large ships would be constrained.

I chose to go first, not necessary because to block. The VCXs are I2 anyway. I wanted to go first to have control where the only real obstablce, the asteroid, goes. I didn't wanted it to end up tugged in one of the corners. I wanted it to matter. So I placed it on Rorger's right side, just within range three of the board edges.

Roger on the other hand placed his obstacles in the corners to create space. In the end, I was happy how it turned out. The clouds wouldn't matter too much anyway. The rock on the other hand was my focal point. I wanted the fight to happen as close to that rock as possible because the VCXs have to fly around it and my ships are much more mobile.

![Placing obstacles](./0.jpg)

In hindsight, I maybe should have placed the rock at the center of the board. I guess that would have ensured its role in the game.

When it comes to ship placement, I always return to the one think I know. Kylo and Vonreg go to the left and right of my board edge and the two blockers are placed in the middle. This allows me to be very reactive and threaten the flanks with Kylo or Vonreg. The cadets can react to the opponent and should have the shortets way to block.

Since I have zero experience flying against that much health and firepower. I wasn't sure what my win condition was. The plan was to dodge the VCX arcs as much as possible and nibble away one of the large ships.

Neither of my ships can land in front of Chopper or the Rebel. Even my dedicated blockers had to be careful. Especially because Chopper can shot at range zero with Zeb as crew.

I didn't expect to have shot's at AP-5. He flew between mom and dad. After the match Roger also told me that he could have docked the Sheathipede if it was in danger. I didn't think about that during the match.

## Turn 1

I followed my game plan and dialed in slow maneuvers. Two straights for everyone. Because all of Rorger's ships turned to Kylo's lane, he boosted and barrel rolled away. Vonreg used a boost to go further down his lane.

![Turn 1](./1.jpg)

## Turn 2

Since Roger pointed all his ships in one direction, I dedicded to turn mine the way and let him come to me. As already said, I didn't want to face his ships head on.

Kylo and the cadets all turned right. I knew this would make the yellow cadet land on the cloud, but ey, it's just a cloud and the strain could be easily cleared with a two speed maneuver in the next round.

The direction he chose also ment that he had to fly around the rock. This made me feel safe with Vonreg and so he flew a three bank, followed up with a barrel roll and a boost. The Lothal Rebel was just a few pixels out of range, meh.

![Turn 2](./2.jpg)

## Turn 3

So far, so okay. I hadn't messed up yet.

The cadets moved into position to block next turn. The blue cadet parked behind the cloud. I thought that this was a relative safe spot to be shot at.

To my surprise Chopper bumped into AP-5. It wasn't that big of deal since I could not benefit from it. However, the bump caused Chopper's shot at the blue cadet to be unobstructed. Still did nothing, ha!

![Turn 3](./3.jpg)

Vonreg two-banked between the two gas clouds. I could have done a more aggresiv move and flew directly towards Roger's ships but I chose the safer route in feat that Chopper would have a shot at Vonreg. Even though it would have been through the rock, Vonreg tends to pop sometimes. I rather get not shot at all.

I also knew that the Lothal Rebel could not get away this time. Daredevil made sure of it.A one left turn placed the Lothal Rebel in range three of Vonreg. Fortunately for me, Roger reinforced the front of the Rebel which meant the Rebel lost two shields instead of one.

Kylo still was in escape mode and flew straight at the gas cloud in front of him. I tried to barrel roll back so that Kylo could threaten a flank with a one hard next turn but it would not have fit. Instead Kylo boosted straight behind the cloud after the barrel roll.

I still was happy with Kylo's position. I would not have turned him in next round anyway. That would have been suicide. However, Roger would have to respect the possibility of Kylo moving in and maybe it would have opened up more lanes for Vonreg.

## Turn 4

I dialed in a two turn and a three bank for the cadets to block fast maneuvers and to protect Kylo. Kylo, trailing behind, started to turn in. 80 points well spend on a moving target. He did not shoot once this game, ugh. This is actually becoming a theme with me playing Kylo. He's always the target.

Vonreg cleared the stress and strain with a two bank, following my primary target the Lothal Rebel. The Rebel already did a white 4k (Leia), didn't saw that coming. Chopper bumped into AP-5. This time on purpose.

Did I say that the cadets where in a position to block? Well, that failed horribly. Not only did I not block any of Roger's ships, the yellow cadet also landed on a cloud. Again.

Did not see the 4k.

Kill AP-5 to force Roger to dock and not have Leia? Rather stayed on target.
