It's time for the second week of the [German TTS League](https://www.tabletop.to/xwing-tabletop-simulator-liga-deutschland)! I lost my first match, as expected. Will I lose my second one? Well, I wouldn't bet on myself. But winning isn't my prime directive anyway. Learning is.

So what was my take away from the last match? Flying aces is hard, especially if you are relatively new to the game. But oh boy do I have fun flying these squirrly ships! Maybe I should switch to a faction that has real aces? Nah!

Speaking of Imperials. My next opponent Hannes is flying Imps. This already gets me excited because most of the times when I play locally, I fly against Scum. And while I don't despise Boba and whatever his wingman of the day is, I find it super exhausting flying against him.

Anyway, on to the game.

## Lists

Hannes told me before the game that he was sorry. He read my last post and that I really struggle flying against high health squads. This is why he chose to pack the most health he can think of into an Imperial squad and bring two shuttles and two Star Wings.

Seriously though, he chose the squad before he read my post. I am more than happy that someone reads what I write. You're allowed, no, entitled to bring whatever makes you happy. Afterall, I am the one flying the meta list ðŸ˜„

Coordinate shenanigens again. This time paired with the ability to lock past range three. All to support the two ordnance carriers, which are armed to the teeth. It doesn't matter if you're at range one, two or three. The have an option to throw at least three dice at you. The range one Advanced Proton Torpedo is extra ugly.

Even the support ships, the two Lamdbas, can dish out some real damage. With the Krennic crew one of them can remove shields for a focus token.

I am still excited about Kylo, Vonreg plus two FOs. It may not be an S-Tier list, or even A-Tier, but I like flying First Order and I really like the TIE/ba. Vonreg with Daredevil is just pure madness.

I swapped some upgrades and pilots for this match. I wanted to make the list more effective and only play stuff that has value regardless of the opponent's squad.

This is why I removed the Mag-

Neither Kylo, nor Vonregs like to be the receipient of torps and missiles. All my ships do not have the health to withstand that firepower.
