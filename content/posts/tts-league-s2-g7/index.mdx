In the second to last week of the German TTS League I am facing Torsten, a guy from the German X-Wing capital Brunswick/Salzgitter. All the big events, like the German Grand Championship, take place there. Must be nice, to live close to where all the X-Wing in Germany happens! I live an eight hour drive away.

## Lists

For all my previous league games I played Kylo, Vonreg plus two FOs and had less than mediocre results. Partially because I am not a great pilot but also because the matchups I ran into weren't advantageous for the squad either.

Having to fight against lots of ordnance carriers and high health squads is almost always an uphill battle for the four TIEs. It is thought to do enough damage if you have to arc-dodge all the time. One wrong move can lose you the game.

In addition, the list only has two real damage dealers in Kylo and Vonreg. One of them is always on the run since they represent the only real threats for the opponent.

Of course the two FOs are great blockers  and can help the fleeing ace, but this still means that there is one lonely ship that can deal damage.

You need a lot of X-Wing knowledge with the squad, considering that it doesn't have the punch to destroy the whole opposing ships in the given time. You just can take out certain pieces and have to trade accordingly. I just don't have the experience necessary to make those decisions (yet).

So I looked at my short list of squads that I wanted to test. With the Xi on the horizon I wanted to give the Upsilon another try and practice squads that want to joust.

I played the shuttle when I started out playing X-Wing. Back then it was all about Tavson, Kylo and Quickdraw. A squad you don't really see these days anymore. Tavson and Quickdraw apparently have fallen out of favor for most of the players, including myself.

However Tavson is one of two Upsilon shuttles that are playable. However, unlike other large base ships the Upsilons didn't see any price reductions in the last points change.

Why FFG? Why!?

Besides Tavson, Thanisson pops up here and there. With Phasma as crew she definitely has potential. The list I had in mind paired her with Daredevil Vonreg and three FOs.

<XWS list={{"description":"","faction":"firstorder","name":"Unnamed Squadron","pilots":[{"id":"majorvonreg","name":"majorvonreg","points":57,"ship":"tiebainterceptor","upgrades":{"talent":["daredevil"]}},{"id":"pettyofficerthanisson","name":"pettyofficerthanisson","points":65,"ship":"upsilonclassshuttle","upgrades":{"tech":["biohexacryptcodes"],"crew":["captainphasma"]}},{"id":"lieutenantrivas","name":"lieutenantrivas","points":27,"ship":"tiefofighter"},{"id":"epsilonsquadroncadet","name":"epsilonsquadroncadet","points":25,"ship":"tiefofighter"},{"id":"epsilonsquadroncadet","name":"epsilonsquadroncadet","points":25,"ship":"tiefofighter"}],"points":199,"vendor":{"yasb":{"builder":"Yet Another Squad Builder 2.0","builder_url":"https://raithos.github.io/","link":"https://raithos.github.io/?f=First%20Order&d=v8ZsZ200Z381X117WWWY281X202WW183WWWWWY265XWY269XWY269XW&sn=Unnamed%20Squadron&obs=core2asteroid2,gascloud2,gascloud3"}},"version":"2.0.0","obstacles":["core2asteroid2","gascloud2","gascloud3"]}}/>

While the list looks solid and the three FOs can make up for the Upsilon's greatest weakness, flying past her, I am a little bit worried about all the single modded two-dice shots from the FOs. Even four dice with only a single modded have a lot of variance. 

If you are not playing Tavson, the action economy of the Upsilon is really poor and so I am not confident that Thanisson poses a big enough threat for the opponent.

Thanks to the [X-Wing discord server](https://discord.gg/Vg8gg7) I stumbled upon Dave's Tavson/Phasma squad last month. That's Phasma *in the SF* not as a crew! I immediately was intrigued to try that combination.

<XWS list={{"description":"","faction":"firstorder","name":"Unnamed Squadron","pilots":[{"id":"majorvonreg","name":"majorvonreg","points":57,"ship":"tiebainterceptor","upgrades":{"talent":["daredevil"]}},{"id":"lieutenanttavson","name":"lieutenanttavson","points":64,"ship":"upsilonclassshuttle"},{"id":"captainphasma","name":"captainphasma","points":50,"ship":"tiesffighter","upgrades":{"talent":["fanatical"],"gunner":["specialforcesgunner"]}},{"id":"lieutenantrivas","name":"lieutenantrivas","points":27,"ship":"tiefofighter"}],"points":198,"vendor":{"yasb":{"builder":"Yet Another Squad Builder 2.0","builder_url":"https://raithos.github.io/","link":"https://raithos.github.io/?f=First%20Order&d=v8ZsZ200Z381X117WWWY289XWWWWWWWY385X181WWW182WWY265XW&sn=Unnamed%20Squadron&obs=core2asteroid2,gascloud2,gascloud3"}},"version":"2.0.0","obstacles":["core2asteroid2","gascloud2","gascloud3"]}}/>

A week ago there was also an [article by Dave](http://stayontheleader.blogspot.com/2020/08/first-order-orientation-what-to-fly.html), where he explains the squad:

> What I love most about this squad [..] is that it's got a bit of everything in it. I've got a blocker in Rivas, I've got an ace in Vonreg, I've got a jouster in Phasma and I've got a big gun shuttle in Tavson. But I've also got coordinate tricks, synergies to unlock between Phasma's ability and Tavson's ability, extra dice mods for Rivas and Vonreg, surprising Coordinate moves or Jam actions. It's only ever been a fun list to put on the table and just whizz about with and in the key Phasma/Tavson axis there's a real core of steel to the squad as well.

The squad is a real brain twister for the opponent to crack. There is no obvious first target.

Do you really want to waste shots at Rivas? Do you want to give Tavson free actions by firing at him? No? But then you can't shoot a Phasma either ... so Vonreg? Eh, try to catch him while you are being followed by nine red dice.

Instead of me having to come up with a plan, I'll let my opponent agonize over the squad. That's nice for a change.

On the other side of the table, Torsten set up a Rebel list which I am quite familiar with. One of my locals, who put me up to participate in the league, plays a very similar squad. 

<XWS list={{"description":"","faction":"rebelalliance","name":"Unnamed Squadron","pilots":[{"id":"wedgeantilles","name":"wedgeantilles","points":57,"ship":"t65xwing","upgrades":{"talent":["crackshot"],"configuration":["servomotorsfoils"]}},{"id":"landocalrissian-modifiedyt1300lightfreighter","name":"landocalrissian-modifiedyt1300lightfreighter","points":86,"ship":"modifiedyt1300lightfreighter","upgrades":{"crew":["niennunb"],"title":["millenniumfalcon"]}},{"id":"roguesquadronescort","name":"roguesquadronescort","points":56,"ship":"ewing","upgrades":{"sensor":["firecontrolsystem"],"astromech":["r3astromech"]}}],"points":199,"vendor":{"yasb":{"builder":"Yet Another Squad Builder 2.0","builder_url":"https://raithos.github.io/","link":"https://raithos.github.io/?f=Rebel%20Alliance&d=v8ZsZ200Z5X116WWWW142Y43XWWW52WWWW154Y23XW113WW4W&sn=Unnamed%20Squadron&obs="}},"version":"2.0.0"}}/>

Wedge is a glass canon. He hits hard but dies fast under concentrated fire. Even though he is a I6, T-65s are good at jousting. They are no arc dodgers or real aces.

Since my game against three E-Wings I am really scared by them. This one doesn't carry any torps though. He will go into the fight with double mods, by acquiring locks beforehand, but after the initial strike the ship isn't that intimidating anymore.

Sitting behind three defense dice with three health and shield, isn't something that goes down easily. Like Wedge, bringing down the Rogue Squadron will require me to focus fire.

The linchpin of the list is Lando. With Nien crew he will pass out actions to his fellow Rebels. Blocking him and denying free actions is important. I don't want to deal with a double modded Wedge or a turtled E-Wing.

I know from experience that if an E-Wing has a focus and an evade, it is almost impossible to get damage through.

My priority target will be Wedge. I can not let him do his thing uncontested. Besides blocking, I want to ignore Lando for the most part. A healthy Falcon in the endgame is scary, but I hope that I can take out his wingmates fast enough so that I still have enough firepower to deal with him later.

## Turn 0

I asked Dave (SOTL) what he brings as obstacles, so I just followed his advice and brought two small gas clouds and a small rock. The Upsilon needs space to fly and turn around. Unlike with my previous list, I don't want any obstacles cluttered around the center of the board.

Torsten packed three debris fields and had to start placing obstacles. I gave him first player so Vonreg would move after Wedge. This also means that Phasma will shoot after the E-Wing and potentially can have an additional mod thanks to a coordinate from Tavson.

While we took turns placing obstacles I tried to create lanes for the Upsilon by spreading out the obstacles and also "block" the board center with a gas cloud. A cloud in the middle of the board would make it easier to turn with the Upsilon.

![Turn 0](./0.jpg)

I was very happy with the resulting obstacle field. There was enough room for my squad to move freely. The real obstacles, rocks and debris fields, were all located in the corners.

The Rebels deployed in the south-west corner after I put down my squad in the opposite corner. I tugged Vonreg behind Tavson. The baron would take the long route and fly towards the gas clouds. If need be, he could take cover there.

Tavson would occupy the middle of the board with Phasma and Rivas covering his left flank.

This formation should make it harder for the Rebels to fly past my shuttle and give me the possibility to react to their movement. Having more than one Rebel ship behind me was the worst case scenario.

![Lanes](./lanes.jpg)

## Turn 1

Tavson and Vonreg flew along the northern board edge. Tavson needed two turns to fly around the little rock so Rivas blocked Phasma to slow down the approach.

Torsten boosted forward with all his Rebels. The Falcon was leading the pack, already advancing halfway to my board edge. All ships were in a position to either turn in using the middle lane or to further fly down the southern board edge.

Using his Experimental Scanners the E-Wing acquired locks on Phasma and Tavson. No target lock on Vonreg? Nice!

![Turn 1](./1.jpg)

## Turn 2

Expecting the Rebels to turn in and joust me, Phasma and Rivas turned their arcs towards the middle of the map. Tavson completed his trip around the rock, staring down the middle lane. Vonreg took the long road with a three bank and covering Tavons right flank.

To my suprise Torsten had no intention of joining me in the middle of the map. His whole squad flew further down the southern board edge, trying to circle around my ships. Lando even boosted to get into a better position for next round.

![Turn 2](./2.jpg)

## Turn 3

The downside of flying along the board edge was that the Rebel's movement became predictable this turn.

Lando could only bank to get his side arc in position to fire at my squad. The E-Wing sat next to the end of the playing field. He had to fly left with a two or three hard. This would land him behind the Falcon and most certainly out of range of anything.

Only Wedge had two options. A two hard left would land him just shy of the debris field. He might have to barrel roll after the maneuver to get into a better position for next round though. Thus the most likely move is to follow Lando.

Anticipating this movement, I dialed in a four straight with Vonreg to clear the deplete. I depleted him the previous turn to get him into a better position after seeing the Rebels flying alongside the board edge.

Tavson flew a one straight. He coordinated Phasma, hoping she would get a good double modded shot at a Rebel ship.

The women in the shining armor did a three hard left to get in front of Tavson. She also locked Lando, the only Rebel ship in Range, donating another lock to Rivas in the process.

Having Phasma sitting in front of Tavson is not ideal since bumping into Phasma would deny him actions. Then again, bumping into Phasma means not moving much and this would keep his guns on the Rebels for a longer time. I rather have unmodded four dice shots than no shot at all with him.

Like Phasma, Rivas flew a three hard to make room for his other teammates. He also presented himself as an easy target for the Rebels. Moving him ahead so much also would allow me to be annoying with him the following rounds and restrict the Rebel's movement a bit.

![Turn 3](./3.jpg)

The Rebels landed right where I expected them. All of my ships had good or even great shots at them.

It was Wedge's turn to start the combat. And what a start he had. Without spending his focus he rolled two hits and a crit into Rivas. Fortunately for me his foils were closed from boosting, so Torsten could only roll three dice. Rivas, with only two defense dice, got an evade plus an eyeball. Spending the evade token meant that the crit only pinged off the shield.

Vonreg's single-modded returning fire on Wedge missed. The Rebel didn't even had to spend his focus.

Lando also chose to fire at Rivas. With double mods this had a chance to remove the FO from the game, but it was Rivas turn to have some hot dice. Only one damage got through.

The unmodded range three shot from the E-Wing couldn't put any additional damage into Rivas. It was time for the First Order to fire back.

Phasma had two great targets: Wedge and Lando. As mentioned before, I planned to get rid of Wedge first, but since Phasma and Rivas both had a lock on the Falcon and Tavson was not in a position to shoot Wedge, I decided to fire with everything at Lando.

With her double mods Phasma put three damage into Lando. The long range shot from Tavson added another which left Lando with one shield left before Rivas' revenge shot.

Spending the lock, Rivas acquired one hit and two crits. I felt sorry for that roll. Without any defensive mods, Lando evaded one damage but the remaining two crits stripped off the last shield and caused a Stunned Pilot.

The crit wasn't that relevant for now but trading two damage on Rivas for six damage on the Falcon definitely felt good …and unexpected.

## Turn 4

Even though I almost halved Lando, a fast maneuver would bring him out of danger. I couldn't risk following Lando and turning my back to Wedge and the E-Wing. Instead I returned to the original plan: Remove Wedge!

Of course it isn't ideal having a half-destroyed Falcon escape. However, getting that much damage into him would mean that he isn't that big of a late game threat anymore. Hopefully I would have time after dealing with the other two Rebels to finish him off.

Rivas tried to block slow maneuvers from Wedge and Lando. Phasma accidentally bumped into Rivas. My plan was to barrel roll left with her after a one bank to block a four straight from Wedge.

Tavson and Vonreg turned their arcs eastwards, attempting to get a shot at the fleeing Wedge. The Upsilon didn't move that much again, because I let it bumped into Phasma.

Unsurprisingly the Falcon moved as fast as he could, with a blue three straight, along my board edge. Wedge, still stressed from last round's boost and focus, tried to get out of trouble with a four straight. It fit and he landed right behind Phasma.

My misjudgement letting the SF bump into Rivas cleared an exit path for Wedge. However he was still in front of Vonreg and Tavson.

The E-Wing flew a one straight and focussed.

![Turn 4](./4.jpg)

Wedge only had a shot at Tavson, but was still stressed and had no mods. He was a sitting duck. Torsten decided to fire at Tavson.

I didn't quite understand this decision. I guess Torsten anticipated Wedge not surviving this round, but shooting at Tavson would give the Upsilon mods and would certainly seal the fate of the X-Wing. Without mods the five dice from Tavson had a good chance not to do enough damage and let Wedge live.

Even if Wedge would only survive on one hull, he still could have done some work. In the next round there would be no incoming shot from the Upsilon and I also would have to turn my ships to finish off Wedge, leaving an uncontested E-Wing in my back.

Without being allowed to roll any defense dice, Wedge stripped two shields from the Upsilon. I used the free actions to lock Wedge and take a focus. Landos shot stripped another shield from the Upsilon.

Vonreg's double modded range one shot removed all three shields from Wedge. Tavons had the honor to finish off the Rebel with a double modded five dice attack.

The E-Wing decided to not shoot at Rivas anymore and rather use his previously acquired lock. The double modded shot at Phasma pinged off one shield. The other damage got passed to Rivas, who remained on one health.

I could have given the damage to Tavson, but it seemed like Torsten had given up on killing the FO, so I wanted to offer him incentive to waste more shots on the little TIE.

Rivas compensated for his great shot last round and missed the fleeing Lando. Phasma had not shot.

## Turn 5

With Wedge gone, my next target was the E-Wing. Lando was already too far away anyway. The Rogue Squadron Escort was all alone, ready to be eaten up by my squad.

Tavons did a stop maneuver and Rivas slooped. I dialed in a two hard for Phasma, expecting the E-Wing to dash forward with a five straight. However, the E-Wing only did a one straight, which made Phasma land pixels in front of him.

The one straight from the E-Wing allowed Vonreg to get double mods. No need to reposition. He also donated a target lock to Rivas.

Lando one-banked further around the rock, locking Tavson and taking a focus for his free action.

![Turn 5](./5.jpg)

The decision to do a slow maneuver left the E-Wing in a really bad spot. Every First Order gun was pointed at him.

Vonreg got two hits and a crit. The E-Wing nattied out. No damage.

Lando put two additional damage into Tavson. no free actions for the Upsilon this time since he was stressed.

Before receiving more incoming fire, the E-Wing shot at Phasma resulting in two damage. One damage was passed to Vonreg. I knew flying him that aggressively would cost me sooner or later. Yet, the additional shots from him made it worth it in my opinion.

After Vonreg's miss, Phasma finally dealt some damage to the E-Wing. She removed two of his shields. Tavson got another three damage into the E-Wing due to a bad defensive roll. Rivas spent his target lock to acquire hit/crit, the E-Wing dodged that shot without needing any mods.

The Rebel survived with one hull left.

This round of combat felt very lopsided at the time. Like my rolls were incredibly good, while Torsten dice failed him. Mostly because this was the third round in a row where the Rebels suffered a lot of damage. 

Nevertheless, [feeding the battle to the dice calculator](http://xwing.gateofstorms.net/2/multi/?d=gwAAAAAAAAAA&a1=MwgAAAAAAAAA&a2=QQgAAAAAAAAA&a3=QQAAAAAgAAAA&a4=IwAAAAAAAAAA) shows that dealing five damage to the E-Wing wasn't that unlikely. I rolled 11 red dice this round. The squad can deal some real damage, if it can focus on a target.

## Turn 6

At the start of this round I was in the lead with 85 to 14. I was able to spread the damage between all of my ships. Rivas was on one hull. Vonreg, Phasma and Tavons were all one shield away from giving up half points. The tables could still turn quickly if I wasn't careful.

With all my ships converging on the E-Wing last round, the Rebel had a good chance to slip through this round.

I bumped Tavson again, clearing his stress and trying to block the five straight from the E-Wing. Rivas tried the same with a one hard. This meant he would keep his stress though. I couldn't barrel roll him to set up a better block.

The five straight from the E-Wing was just enough to fly over Tavson and Rivas.

The one hard followed by a Daredevil boost from Vonreg and a one straight from Phasma ensured I still had shots at the E-Wing this round.

Lando continued his trip around the rock.

![Turn 6](./6.jpg)

Because the E-Wing barrel rolled behind Tavson after the five straight he was left without any defensive mods. Vonreg's single-modded shot was enough to deal the last damage.

Meanwhile Lando put another two damage in the Upsilon. With five hull left, Torstenfinally halved Tavson.

113 to 46 was the new standing.

## Turn 7

With only Lando left and him halfway across the map, I used this round to regroup my squad. Neither of us had shots.

![Turn 7](./7.jpg)

## Turn 8

The last time I had to hunt down a Falcon the clock prevented me from finishing the job. I wanted to get him this time.

Lando tried to run for cover behind the clouds. All my ships turned towards him, leaving him no room to escape.

![Turn 8](./8.jpg)

Vonreg spent his lock and focus for two hits and a crit. The Falcon rolled two natural evades, so only the crit got through (Damaged Sensor Array).

The follow up shot by Tavson put another two damage and a crit, in the form a Loose Stabilizer, into the Falcon.

Rivas didn't had the chance to fire at Lando. The General of the Alliance removed him from the game.

## Turn 9

Because of all the crits the Falcon suffered (Stunned Pilot, Damaged Sensor Array, Loose Stabilizer), he only could fly straight onto a gas cloud. Thus I turned my remaining three ships in that direction.

![Turn 9](./9.jpg)

The first shot from Vonreg was enough to deal the last damage to the Falcon. The game ended 200 to 59.

## Conclusion

I definitely had some favorable dice in this game which made it much more one-sided than it should have been. Nevertheless, the key to this game was the first engagement.

My squad had a very good time on target and was able to focus on one Rebel ship after another. In fact, Tavson even had two more rounds of fire than Phasma! He was a central force behind this victory. Rolling five dice with double mods feels goooood.

Other than that, I really have to learn how to fly the Upsilon. Bumping it into another ship is nice for time on target, but I would also like to get some more (coordinate) actions.

The same is true for flying Phasma alongside Tavson. Ideally you want the SF on one of the flanks not in front of the Upsilon. I need to think about how to better deploy the squad.

I had a lot of fun flying the squad. The synergy between Tavson and Phasma is better than I expected. Even if you can not pass damage to Tavson, distributing the damage between all ships is great for holding onto points.
