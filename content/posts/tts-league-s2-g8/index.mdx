We reached the last swiss round in second season of the German TTS league. I am 2:5 before the match so this will by my last match. It was a lot of fun to meet X-Wing players from all over the country and I will definitely try to come back for a feature season.

If you like me and want to dip your toe into tournament play, I really can recommend league play. It is much less exhausting than a regular tournament and there is lots of time after a match to talk with your opponent about the match. So you can learn and get better at moving plastic ships around the table.

## Lists

After enyjoing [Dave's Phasma list](http://stayontheleader.blogspot.com/2020/08/first-order-orientation-what-to-fly.html) last week, I decided to stick with it. Playing Tavson is much more fun than I remembered. Who doesn't like to through a double modded fice-dice attack at your opponent?!

In addition, Phasma is the perfect wingwoman for him. Well, maybe it is the other way around. I can't think of a better ship to pass of damage to than Tavson. Enabling Quickdraw's bonus attack that way seems rather dumb.

Vonreg and Rivas complete the squad. I played both in my other squad. In my mind, Rivas is the best FO. He is a perfect blocker and with a TIE/ba in the squad he more often than not gets a free target lock. Ignore him and he will supprise you with double modded.

This might be an unpopular oppinion, but I find that the Red Baron can be as threatening as Kylo. Yes, it is much easier to scare him off but for 19 points less than Kylo I wonder if Daredevil Vonreg isn't the correct choice most of the time. Especially, because you can spent the points elsewhere.

My opponent for this week, Mark, brought an Imperial ace squad. Vader, Rexler and Mauler. It get the first two, but I am deeply confused by Mauler. Especially because of the Stealth Device and Marksmanship. He is a cheap I5 but in a three ship list he is not work the 40 points. Getting him into range one and not die immediately seems almost impossible to me.

Vader and Rexler are still scary. The Seatlh Device on Vader makes him harder to kill, yet most people prefer Afterburners on him. Not getting shot is better than being able to roll one more dice and the upgrade costs two less points.

Rexler doesn't really need any upgrade. Some people play Juke on the defenders, however they already pretty point intensive without any upgrades. FCS seems good on him.

As for my strategy, the TIE/ln is the obvious target. *If* I can get him in a few arcs at the same time, he shouldn't be able to survive. Vader without Afterburners is also a bit more predicatble, since he has only one reposition (barrel roll). Punshing through the his three force, four defense dice seems a lot of work. Similar to Mauler, *if* I can shot him, it only can do damage *if* he is more than one arc.

Rexler will do defener things. I doubt that I can catch him before any other of the Imperial ships is removed from the game. I will try to limit the damage he does, while I mostly ignoring him.

While thats the plan, I anticipate that it will happen completly differently. Against an ace squad you have to reevaluate your win condition after every round. The aces will out fly you. We'll see how much Tavson can do against this immensly mobile squad.

The only good thing is that Mark's squad comes in at 199. I win the bid and Vonreg can move after Vader. Maybe Vonreg can do some work and force or bait the Imperials in a position, which I can take advantage of.

## Turn 0

My goal is to spread the obstacles as much as possible and have the gas clouds in the middle. This way there is enough room for the Upsilon to turn around and not much possibilies for the Imerpials to hide behind rocks.

We ended up with a good open field. Just what I wanted.

I deploy Rivas, Phasma and Tavson in the north-east corner. Tavson is facing Mark's board edge. Phasma and Rivas face southbound.

Because Mark didn't placed any of his ships yet I wanted to cover both angles with my jousting block. Depending on his deployment I can either way. Gathering Tavson, Phasma and Rivas would require two rounds. They would have to fly passed the rock.

To my supprise, Mark placed his ships directly on the other side, starting down Tavson. Ready to joust.

Was he really going to joust me with his aces? Or is this a ruse?

Still confsued about Mark's setup I deployed Vonreg in center so that he can rush behind the gas cloud in the middle and cut off the aces' escape path if Mark would really turn away instead of jousting me.

*PS: Get used to the white lines on that rock. TTS sometimes does that.* ðŸ˜„

## Turn 1

Lets think this through. If Mark dashed forward and jousts, he most likely tries to catch Tavson off guard. As mentioned, I need some time to group up.

Because of Vader and Mauler he can "only" do a five straight. Rexler is the only one that can add aboost. Doing a stop with Tavson is the safest move and will will give the rest of my squad time to join the fight. 

Rivas does a three bank and Phasma flies a two hard to not get in each other's way. Vonreg five-straights and follows it up with a barrel roll and boost.

The Imperials all do a five straight.

## Turn 2

Huh, he is really doing it. Or is he? I mean he still could bail and go after Vonreg. Either way he will definitely get shots.
