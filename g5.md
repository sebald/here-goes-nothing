how fast will they turn in?

thought about kylo to do a 5 straight ... dont
WORKS!!?! (wanted to do a faint turn one)

vr into rose -> 2 hits/crit (natural), 1 hull fuel leak
tallie into scorch -> r3 + obstructed + hit/crit -> evade + cloud
rose same into scroch -> 2 crits into 5 evades
red into vklyo -> dodges -> showed the dark side
scroch to hits into rose -> nothuing thanks to re rools

---

kylos escape path ? 2 hard or 2 bank?
will get blocked FUUUCK

lots of blocks ... ergs

vr into red -> nothing
tallie into kylo -> r2, 2 natural hits -> evade + force
greet r3 into rivas -> strips focus (only one dmg worh it?)
rose into rivas ERGS! with 3 rerolls -> 2 hits + crit -> evade + cloud -> looses shield

now to the fun part

r2s on kylo, red nothing tino kylo (3 evades ...), one shield from red
rivas blanks

how to get kylo out of that mess? 5s or 1hard?w

i dont want to kill rose because shes thought to kill

vr into talli -> 4 hits, evade + focus -> 1mdg
talli into r3 kylo, nothing ( no ficus!)
greer -> scorch r4 nothing
scorch nothing

rose 3 hits into tivas -> done!
red r2 into scroch for 2 dmg,
yellow no shot

---

talli r3 into kylo -> nothing
greet 2 r2,

scorch, activate -> nothing 2:2

I need some points, so time for a hail mary.

does kylo fiiiiiiit !!!! need it to win anyway ... if not he gots 80 points. meh! :D

MOV doesn't matter anyway. The outcome is binary. Win or lose.

---

kylo will be cornered anyway, just do it!
(should have tanked the shots and not stress)

didn't see the talon from red

vr into tlli nmothing
talli r2 into scorch
greer nothing into sroch
scorch activates for 2, nothing into talli

---

talked afterwards

more offensive blocks? between

i think i am too afraid of a joust

what to do with the list? Kylo, VR+DD, Rivas + cadet is only 185. Who to reasonable spent the points?

A-Wing not so scary for Kylo?

finally some paint for kylo on defense.
