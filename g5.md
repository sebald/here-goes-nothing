I need some points, so time for a hail mary.

does kylo fiiiiiiit !!!! need it to win anyway ... if not he gots 80 points. meh! :D

MOV doesn't matter anyway. The outcome is binary. Win or lose.

---

kylo will be cornered anyway, just do it!
(should have tanked the shots and not stress)

talked afterwards

more offensive blocks? between

i think i am too afraid of a joust

what to do with the list? Kylo, VR+DD, Rivas + cadet is only 185. Who to reasonable spent the points?

A-Wing not so scary for Kylo?

finally some paint for kylo on defense.

was not aggressive enought with the TIEs, they are pawns its okay if they die and I can trade them for shots with Kylo and Vonreg

Do the unexpected with Kylo. Because I had multiple options to turn in and have Kylo's gun on the enemy.

I get better with Kylo and generate option. Now I have to learn to embrace them.
