talked afterwards

more offensive blocks? between

i think i am too afraid of a joust

what to do with the list? Kylo, VR+DD, Rivas + cadet is only 185. Who to reasonable spent the points?

A-Wing not so scary for Kylo?

finally some paint for kylo on defense.

was not aggressive enought with the TIEs, they are pawns its okay if they die and I can trade them for shots with Kylo and Vonreg

Do the unexpected with Kylo. Because I had multiple options to turn in and have Kylo's gun on the enemy.

I get better with Kylo and generate option. Now I have to learn to embrace them.
