wanted to learn to play kylo better and be more aggressive,
but MUNITION! AGAIN NOOOOO!!!!

---

reactive play, see where he's going trying to fly past ang get pod shots of
dive to finish off?

can remove all obstacles uuugffgsdahsdjk!? no place to hide
can block lanes with the seismics, so where to go?
seismics to the right (not the middle)

---

2s vs 1s

---

1s from imps, the big berlin wall

how to fly by them!? try to break one side open!? hmmm

---

this is the turn to break? fast with kylo and vonreg
not that scared about the regular shots

guess i have to losoe some ties

all fast maneuvers
OH CAN NOT SPENT FOCUS ON DEFENSE

vr + tl -> 3 hits (depleted) -> 2 dmg
kylo into purple -> 2 eyes + blank -> spend on force -> natty evades

red into muse -> 2 hits + crit + focus -> spend focus -> lose shield
yellow into muse -> 2 hits + crits + focus -> 1 crit (fuel leak)

muse into red -> r3 -> 1 hit -> evades
