yellow two hull left, not enough for kylo's points
with two "dead" damage dealer, no way to kill yellow

he can go either way, r1 left no shot for Rvias

blue sloops, rivas two straight and hopefull blocks yellow

yellow bumps

red into rivas, hit crit, one dmg
green r1 into rivas, fails nothing

cadet nothing

---

vr turns in to shoooooot, gain at least SOME points ...
only 9 minutes, want to regen with VR one more to not give up points it possible

clock is ticking DOWN

yellow doesn't bump ...damn has and focus

vonreg 3dmg into yellow, two natural evades, takes one dmg

red -> rivas with TL 3 dmg, 3 evades with focus
green -> 2 dmg -> 2 evades from rivas
yellow into VR -> 2 into blanks

cadet shoots yellow from board .. finally
rvias only eyeballs and blank

green into rivas, natties ... lol
cadet for two into red, does one shield
