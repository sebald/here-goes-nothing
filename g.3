5 straight! (pondering if vonreg should bank instead of straight)
luke on obs

vr -> luke -> blanks 2 shields, but used focus

luke shot back, 2 hits, jiust in arc -> blanks 

scorch -> han 1 dmg

scorc -> luke, nothing

2 shields on vonreg much more worth than 2 shields on luke,

tilled a bit, need to calm down.

---

tl vr auf luke so rivas get tl

hand 4 hits with eye into scroch, 2 blanks one eye

vr -> into han nothing

kylo -> luke r3, obs -> 2 hits, 3 evades

blank + eye into luke

---

rivas tried to block luke, roleld back, front would have blocked the k-turn :(

scorched also failes to blocksw

luke i7 -> vonreg in rage :( protoon torp into vonreg
3 hits, one crit 

han into scroch, force, lone wolf, 2 hits one crit -> with focus 3 evades phew

kylo, 3 hits 1  crit, one evade -> wounded pilot
scroch 3 hits, luke with one hull alive. hull upgrade!

dice stats: 4 evade above average. rolled 11 evades, expected 7

---

scorchs tries to block again!
rivas blocks escape path of luke
kylo HAS to k-turn to try to catch luke

because of the bump by rivas, luke  just in arc?
han runs with a 2 hardt into scrochinto scroch (we tested everything would have bumped)

if only VR could be here

fley way to agreesive with vonreg
